I have migrated from [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/) to [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/) for the blog from my old blog https://mhmd.io.



And also from [mkdocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) to [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/) for the wiki and documentation from https://docs.mhmd.io

Now I can manage the website, blog, and documentation using [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/) only which based on [React](https://reactjs.org/).

I will decommission `mhmd.io` domain and use only `cloudfalcon.dev` for both personal and professional work.
