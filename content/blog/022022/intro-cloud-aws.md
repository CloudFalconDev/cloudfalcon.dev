I'm glad to share that I will coordinate and organize two days `bootcamp` event about `Cloud`, `AWS` and `DevOps` with collaboration with [GazaSkyGeeks](https://gazaskygeeks.com/).

We started with online session about 1:30 hrs about Cloud and AWS.

In the session we explained what is Cloud Computing, and showed AWS Global Infrastructure.

Attendances from 120 to 100.
