# Static Assets Guide

Static assets are stored in the [public/img/](mdc:public/img) directory, organized by type:

- [svg/](mdc:public/img/svg): Contains SVG logos and icons (e.g., AWS, Azure, GCP, CNCF, DigitalOcean, HashiCorp).
- [png/](mdc:public/img/png): Contains PNG logos and images (e.g., Slack, GitHub, Notion, Datadog, Pulumi, Terraform, etc.).

These assets are used throughout the app for branding, partner logos, and UI illustrations.
