# Utilities Guide

The [lib/](mdc:lib) directory contains shared utility functions for the project:

- [utils.ts](mdc:lib/utils.ts): Provides the `cn` function for merging and composing class names, using `clsx` and `tailwind-merge`.

These utilities are imported by UI components and other files to simplify class name management and promote code reuse.
