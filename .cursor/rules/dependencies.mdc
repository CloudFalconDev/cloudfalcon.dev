- **DevDependencies**: Includes TypeScript, ESLint, Prettier, Tailwind CSS, and related plugins for development and code quality.
- **Scripts**: Common scripts are `dev` (start development server), `build` (build for production), `start` (run production build), and `lint` (run linter).

Use this file to manage packages and run project tasks.
